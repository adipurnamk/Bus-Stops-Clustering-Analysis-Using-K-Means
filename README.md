# Coursera_Capstone

This project original idea is from [Stanislav Rogozhin](https://towardsdatascience.com/classification-of-moscow-metro-stations-using-foursquare-data-fb8aad3e0e4), and his notebook can be find [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theptyza/map_moscow_metro_foursquare/blob/master/Moscow.ipynb)
He was doing clustering for Moscow's Metro and I apllied his methodology to Banda Aceh's Trans Koetaradja Bus Stop.
